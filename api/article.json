2008, and when he formally opened his re-election campaign in May, he put it in his speech again. He will \u201cnever be a perfect president,\u201d he said, a line he now repeats at stop after stop. The unspoken subtext: It\u2019s not my fault if you didn\u2019t listen or expected too much.<\/p> <p>If rapturous supporters in Denver four years ago were not paying attention, those expected here on Thursday night surely know better. This is not a perfect president; this is a proud yet humbled president, a confident yet scarred president, a dreamer mugged by reality, a pragmatist confounded by ideology, a radical to some, a sellout to others.<\/p> <p>This is a president who has yet to realize the lofty expectations that propelled him from obscurity to the Oval Office, whose idealism or na&iuml;vet&eacute; or hubris has been tempered by four years in the fires. Long after the messiah jokes vanished, the oh-so-mortal <a href=\"http:\/\/elections.nytimes.com\/2012\/candidates\/barack-obama?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Barack Obama\" className=\"meta-per\">Barack Hussein Obama<\/a> is left to make the case that while progress is slow, he is taking America to a better place \u2014 and that he will be a better president over the next four years.<\/p> <p>If Denver was all about promise, Charlotte is all about patience. Whether Americans grant the 44th president a four-year extension will depend in part on his ability to reconcile the heady aspirations of 2008 with the messy results of the four years that followed. Remade by his time in office, the candidate of change will now argue for staying the course.<\/p> <p>Although \u201che certainly seems more grizzled or hardened,\u201d as his former economics adviser Austan Goolsbee observed, Mr. Obama expresses confidence that he has figured out how to wield power in an age of political polarization and economic stagnation.<\/p> <p>Now on his third chief of staff, he describes his change in management in sports terms, no longer picking the best overall athlete but whoever best fits the particular job. Burned by failed Roosevelt Room summits with Republican leaders and faced with implacable resistance, he has abandoned the inside game to barnstorm the country pressuring lawmakers. Once a virtual prime minister tethered to Congress, he now advances <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/subjects\/i\/immigration_and_refugees\/index.html?inline=nyt-classNameifier\" title=\"More articles about immigration.\" className=\"meta-classNameifier\">immigration<\/a>, environmental and education initiatives through executive authority.<\/p> <p>In the privacy of the West Wing, of course, there are moments when he feels discouraged by what he has not accomplished or unappreciated for what he has. \u201cThat\u2019s been our sweet spot \u2014 finding policies that don\u2019t make anybody happy, that make both sides angry,\u201d he has joked, Mr. Goolsbee said. \u201cAnd the experts then say, well, they didn\u2019t do enough anyway.\u201d<\/p> <p>But those close to him say he takes the long view, understands things will not change as quickly as he likes, and retains his famed never-too-high, never-too-low reserve. During the dark days of summer 2011 when a grand bargain with Republicans on spending <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/26\/us\/politics\/26deal.html?pagewanted=all\">slipped away<\/a>, he took a walk with David Axelrod, his strategist, to the White House basketball court and shot hoops.<\/p> <p>\u201cDo you ever rethink this, about whether it was worth doing?\u201d Mr. Axelrod remembered asking.<\/p> <p>Mr. Obama looked at him incredulously. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in public life, where else would you rather be?\u201d<\/p> <p><strong>The Limits of Rationality<\/strong><\/p> <p>A few months ago, Mr. Obama read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/11\/27\/books\/review\/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html?pagewanted=all\">\u201cThinking, Fast and Slow,\u201d<\/a> by Daniel Kahneman, about how people make decisions \u2014 quick, instinctive thinking versus slower, contemplative deliberation. For Mr. Obama, a deliberator in an instinctive business, this may be as instructive as any political science text.<\/p> <p>Mr. Obama, the 51-year-old Harvard law graduate, sees himself as a rational thinker and came to office with what might be called the Reasonable Person Theory of Government. If he could simply sit down and talk with other political actors, whether they be Republicans from the House or mullahs from Tehran, he seemed certain he could work something out. His faith in his own powers of persuasion was deep.<\/p> <p>But politics is often not rational, at least not as Mr. Obama defined it. The Iranians have proved immune to Mr. Obama\u2019s charm, as have the North Koreans, the Taliban and Vladimir V. Putin. So have the Republicans and, for that matter, even some Democrats.<\/p> <p>After a year of failed Middle East peacemaking, he conceded being too confident that he could cajole Israelis and Palestinians into resolving age-old disputes. \u201cWe overestimated our ability to persuade them to do so when their politics ran contrary to that,\u201d he concluded at the time.<\/p> <p>So, too, has his reliance on oratory diminished. At first, there was no problem, it seemed, that could not be solved by a presidential address. \u201cRace problem? Speech,\u201d one former aide recalled. \u201cAfghanistan? Speech.\u201d But speeches by themselves rarely generated the action he sought.<\/p> <p>Indeed, Mr. Obama in private sometimes expresses surprise at the constraints of the office. Lulled by his success in passing an $800 billion <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/subjects\/u\/united_states_economy\/economic_stimulus\/index.html?inline=nyt-classNameifier\" title=\"More articles about economic stimulus.\" className=\"meta-classNameifier\">stimulus package<\/a> 24 days after his inauguration, and perhaps not fully cognizant of the tone set by doing so almost exclusively with Democratic votes, he found that everything else came harder, like his health care program, or not at all, like climate and immigration legislation.<\/p> <p>He keeps a list and argues that he has fulfilled most of his core promises. He pulled the country back from the economic abyss, rescued the auto industry, killed the world\u2019s top terrorist, withdrew troops from Iraq, imposed regulations on Wall Street, put two liberal justices on the Supreme Court, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia and cut taxes for the middle className.<\/p> <p>Yet looking back, he realizes that some of his \u201cheal the planet\u201d ambitions that would prove fodder for mockery by Mitt Romney, his Republican rival, were unrealistic, at least in four years. During the 2008 campaign, he said he would talk with rogue leaders from countries including Iran and Cuba, make peace between Pakistan and India so Pakistan could shift forces to the Afghan border, close the prison at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, win Senate approval of a never-ratified test ban treaty, negotiate legislation live on C-Span and usher in a new era of bipartisanship.<\/p> <p>His contemplative decision-making can be isolating. He does not readily let others in. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to gain the president\u2019s confidence \u2014 not trust, but confidence in your judgment,\u201d Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. observed in an interview this summer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come easily to this president.\u201d As a result, he said, Mr. Obama demands a rigorous process. When someone proposes something, the president\u2019s reaction is, \u201cGet me a paper on that.\u201d When he receives it, Mr. Biden said, \u201che devours it. He masters it.\u201d<\/p> <p>His deliberation proved refreshing to those weary of President George W. Bush\u2019s swagger. \u201cI like to know what I\u2019m talking about before I speak,\u201d Mr. Obama once said when asked why it took him days to respond to a controversy.<\/p> <p>But when he waited to speak out about the would-be underwear bomber at Christmas 2009 or the BP <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/subjects\/o\/oil_spills\/gulf_of_mexico_2010\/index.html?inline=nyt-classNameifier\" title=\"More articles about oil spills.\" className=\"meta-classNameifier\">oil spill<\/a> in 2010, he paid a political price. He learned the public wants to see its president during crises. So when a gunman shot up a movie theater in Colorado this summer, Mr. Obama appeared before cameras within hours.<\/p> <p>As Mr. Kahneman said in an interview, \u201cBeing a slow thinker for a leader is not necessarily an advantage because the public likes a leader to think quickly and react instinctively.\u201d<\/p> <p><strong>Hardball Time<\/strong><\/p> <p>How has Mr. Obama applied the lessons he learned? One day last spring, aides told him interest rates on federal <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/subjects\/s\/student_loans\/index.html?inline=nyt-classNameifier\" title=\"More articles about student loans.\" className=\"meta-classNameifier\">student loans<\/a> would double on July 1 unless Congress acted. Early on in his presidency, Mr. Obama might have invited lawmakers to the White House.<\/p> <p>Instead, he headed to <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/subjects\/p\/presidents_and_presidency_us\/air_force_one\/index.html?inline=nyt-classNameifier\" title=\"More articles about Air Force One.\" className=\"meta-classNameifier\">Air Force One<\/a> and flew to college campuses in North Carolina and Colorado to castigate Congress for not heading off the rate hike. There was never any debate about the strategy; no one, even Mr. Obama, thought about talking with Republicans.<\/p> <p>\u201cOur view on student loans was they wouldn\u2019t do it without really putting their backs against the wall,\u201d said David Plouffe, the president\u2019s senior adviser. \u201cHe realized this was a simple thing, it was clear, it was something we could motivate people on.\u201d<\/p> <p>Republicans angrily accused the president of bad faith. \u201cHe was making a political argument,\u201d said Representative John Kline of Minnesota, chairman of the education committee. \u201cI never saw any engagement from the White House about what really to do about it.\u201d<\/p> <p>Maybe so, but Obama aides crowed that it worked because Republicans instantly came out against the rate increase, too. Republicans said they saw it the other way, arguing that they defused the Obama attack by reacting quickly. Either way, it was a sign of how much the president had changed.<\/p> <p>No longer would he give Republicans the benefit of the doubt. Having been surprised by the unbreakable solidarity against his initiatives, Mr. Obama came to privately use the phrase \u201cnot on the level,\u201d meaning Republicans were not playing straight. \u201cThey came in like they were the East German judge at the Olympics,\u201d said Mr. Goolsbee. \u201cHe could hit the triple flip and they would give him a 2. That was a pretty grim lesson that he had to learn.\u201d<\/p> <p>In Mr. Obama\u2019s mind, it is a one-way street, and he takes no responsibility for the divisions, dismissing Republicans who consider him highhanded. \u201cElections have consequences,\u201d he told Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican whip at the time, during an early meeting, \u201cand Eric, I won.\u201d<\/p> <p>The breakdown of last year\u2019s grand bargain talks proved a turning point. \u201cThat was a searing experience,\u201d Mr. Plouffe recalled. The lesson: Forget negotiations and use the bully pulpit. Policy is not about applying reason; it\u2019s about applying power.<\/p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to convince them by sitting around the table and talk about what\u2019s good for the country,\u201d said John D. Podesta, who ran Mr. Obama\u2019s transition and still advises him occasionally. \u201cYou had to demonstrate that there\u2019s political pain if you don\u2019t produce an acceptable outcome.\u201d<\/p> <p><strong>Bold and Cautious<\/strong><\/p> <p>If Mr. Obama has changed over his presidency, in part it suggests Americans never really knew him to begin with. Where conservatives see an unremitting liberal, supporters on the left wish he were. To mystified admirers, it is unrequited love. When they read in David Maraniss\u2019s biography of how a girlfriend told him, \u201cI love you,\u201d only to have him reply, \u201cThank you,\u201d some joked they knew how she felt.<\/p> <p>On the hustings, Mr. Obama is more careful to reply in kind. When someone shouts out, \u201cWe love you,\u201d he calls out, \u201cI love you back.\u201d But sometimes it does not feel that way. His has become a bloodless presidency, built on cold calculations, not quixotic crusades. His argument now boils down to asking voters to stick with him because the other side will revive failed policies that would enrich the wealthy, shred safety-net programs and undermine the economy.<\/p> <p>With unemployment stuck above 8 percent and his approval ratings stuck below 50 percent, Mr. Obama has turned to the sort of campaigning he once disdained. The man who bristled when critics claimed without evidence that he was born in Kenya or was a Muslim now does not object as advisers and allies make unsubstantiated assertions about Mr. Romney\u2019s taxes and business record.<\/p> <p>Asked about such incidents, he says the behavior of the Republicans is worse. He does not talk about changing Washington rules; he is playing by the rules as he found them.<\/p> <p>He is sensitive to the costs he has imposed on his own party. After the Supreme Court upheld his health care program, he reached out to&nbsp;three House Democrats who lost in 2010&nbsp;after supporting the legislation, including Tom Perriello of&nbsp;Virginia, who said liberals have come around.&nbsp;\u201cTo the extent there was a passion for&nbsp;Obama in 2008, that\u2019s matured into a&nbsp;comfort and a trust by 2012,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>Mr. Obama is a curious mixture of bold and cautious. He spent months in what amounted to a grueling graduate seminar on Afghanistan and then disregarded his vice president and top advisers to order 30,000 more troops to the war zone. Even the action considered his most decisive, ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, took place only after months of secretly monitoring intelligence and considering options.<\/p> <p>He defied advisers by pressing for his expansive health care program rather than settling for a \u201cskinny\u201d alternative. Yet he stays doggedly away from hot-button issues like gun control and race, took two years to lift the ban on gays and lesbians in the military, and took even longer to endorse <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/subjects\/s\/same_sex_marriage\/index.html?inline=nyt-classNameifier\" title=\"More articles about Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions, and Domestic Partnerships.\" className=\"meta-classNameifier\">same-sex marriage<\/a>. He appointed a bipartisan commission to fix the nation\u2019s finances, then shelved its plan.<\/p> <p>On foreign policy as well, he has his priorities, and those that do not fit are put to the side. Since pulling American forces out of Iraq, for example, he has seemed removed from its fate. Adm. Dennis C. Blair, Mr. Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence until he was pushed out over policy and personality differences, said the president took a checklist approach to foreign policy overly influenced by domestic politics.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere quickly developed what I thought of as the top-10 list of individual issues that needed to be worked \u2014 Iran, a treaty with Russia, the South China Sea, the Middle East peace process,\u201d he said. \u201cNever did there seem to be an idea of a strategy \u2014 where do we want to be, what\u2019s important, and how do we get there?\u201d<\/p> <p>Moreover, he said, decisions on foreign policy were shadowed by concern for how they would play with the American public. \u201cDomestic political considerations were ground in very early, very early,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p><strong>A Second Term<\/strong><\/p> <p>The isolation can be palpable. Riding in his motorcade after an event, Mr. Obama sometimes stares out the windows at the world he cannot really touch. When he arrives at a hotel at the end of a campaign day, he confers with aides in his suite, then sometimes asks what they plan to do the rest of the evening. When they mention going to the hotel bar to unwind, he notes he is not free to follow, essentially confined in his suite until morning.<\/p> <p>\u201cHe was a little wistful when I was with him about his new public life, his presidential life, and its cost in terms of isolation from ordinary life experiences,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin, his former Illinois colleague.<\/p> <p>Mr. Obama enjoys watching \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d and recently took in the Will Ferrell movie \u201cThe Campaign\u201d (not great, in his review, but some funny scenes). His fixation with ESPN remains unabated, and, like others in Washington, he ruminates on the wisdom of the Nationals\u2019 sitting down their star pitcher, Stephen Strasburg, before the playoffs.<\/p> <p>But his inner circle is the same tight group it was before. It is probably fair to say he has made no new friends since moving to Washington. \u201cThe times he wants downtime or personal time, he seems to naturally gravitate to the people he\u2019s known for a very long time,\u201d said John W. Rogers Jr., an old friend.<\/p> <p>In private, he speaks of his challenger with disdain. While intellectually understanding the odds, aides say, the president finds it hard to conceive of losing to Mr. Romney, a rival he does not consider a serious thinker who knows what he wants to do with the country. The president has told people he is determined to win because he believes the economy will bounce back and does not want Mr. Romney getting credit.<\/p> <p>Mr. Obama has convinced himself, or so he says, that things will be different next time around. Should he win, maybe Republicans will finally cooperate.<\/p> <p>\u201cI believe that if we\u2019re successful in this election \u2014 when we\u2019re successful in this election \u2014 that the fever may break,\u201d he said last spring. \u201cMy expectation is that after the election, now that it turns out the goal of beating Obama doesn\u2019t make much sense because I\u2019m not running again, that we can start getting some cooperation again.\u201d<\/p> <p>If that sounds like optimism overcoming experience, Mr. Obama promises to&nbsp;be on guard. \u201cI\u2019m not going to just play it safe,\u201d he&nbsp;tells aides. But he intends to play by the&nbsp;lessons he has learned.<\/p>","reconciled":1,"archive_type":"Send to
